Imagine two classmates. One is disciplined—always does the homework, studies hard, and never misses deadlines. The other wastes time, copies assignments, and rarely puts in effort.

In the long run, the disciplined student will probably earn more money. But here’s the question: how much more? Maybe a hundred thousand dollars. But millions more? Probably not.

That’s where frustration sets in. The hardworking student might think: “I sacrificed sleep, followed every rule, and did everything right—yet I’m only a little ahead of someone who barely tried.”

Why does this happen? Because both students are running the same race. And in that race, the prize is almost fixed. If the maximum reward is two hundred thousand dollars, then no matter how hard you run, you can’t win millions more. To do that, you’d need to choose a different race.

And the chance to choose comes at the start. Instead of blindly following instructions, if you pause and ask, “Why am I doing this? Where will this lead?”, you might discover a smarter path. A different race doesn’t always mean switching fields—it can also mean approaching the same work in a more creative or innovative way.

The problem is, we often think too short-term. We take the path of least resistance. Scrolling TikTok feels easier than reading a novel. Jumping straight into homework feels more productive than pausing to think. In the short run, you may look slower. Others might already be pages ahead while you’re still planning.

But in the long run, their growth stays linear, while yours—if you put effort at the start—becomes exponential.

So next time you have two free hours, don’t just dive into your phone. Stop. Ask yourself: What’s the best thing I can do with this time? Yes, it takes effort to think—and even more effort to choose guitar over scrolling. But here’s the truth: two hours of scrolling will leave nothing behind, while two hours of learning guitar could stay with you for life—and be far more fun than mindless scrolling.

Because in the end, success isn’t just about how hard you run. It’s also about whether you chose the right race.
